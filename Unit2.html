    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites  </h3>
    <p>
        Constraints can apply to both the clients and the project itself. [1] The best way to work around them is through creativity and imagination. 
        The first problem before everything else you might come across is finding a good ‘Domain Name’. 
        Most likely, you’re idea for a name of your website has already been used before and overlaps with others. 
        Therefore you must find a way to name your website something that stands out on top of being different from others. 
        Using a different name can be as simple as putting a number at the end, 
        but memorable domain names are what can get found by others, that’s why it’s important to use the right key phrases. 
        Though this will have to account for misspelling it as plural as that is the most common mistakes while searching.

    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - 
        describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h3>
    
    <p>
        The way to make your website accessible to disabled users is by finding solutions that can creatively help them bypass what they’re unable to do.[3] 
        The first way to do this is by using ‘Alt Tags’, 
        which allows even a user with visual impairments to navigate the site by hearing a description of what his mouse is hovering over. 
        This must be paired with the user’s screen reader that would help them, 
        but needs the website designer to describe what they are hovering over accurately so that they can gauge what they are looking at. 
        Of course, put periods in abbreviations or else it will be read wrong by a reader. 
        Add subtitles to describe simpler, or another language altogether. 
        The proper use of colours make it easier on the eyes while bigger items are easier to click on. 
        Simplicity in a lot of areas can also help an elderly audience who can’t keep up. 
        Lastly, know your audience and create a simple link that guides them to a page which helps them access the most important areas. 
        This last part is a lot more about helping the user navigate than persuade them to stay on the website.[4]

    <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h3>
    
    <p>
        For images, JPEG is most commonly used even though PNG can also come in handy in certain instances. 
        The latter is especially useful since it allows the designer to add more image colours without taking too much space.[5] 
        GIFs can also be incorporated to add simple looped animations which don’t take up too much space due to their lower visual quality. 
        SVG is best for line art and drawings despite being worse for imagery, 
        and are sometimes similar to GIFs as they can be animated too. 
        It all depends on the designer and what they would like to add rather than one size fitting all. 
        Although some browsers may not support particular file types, 
        it is better to know your best options and working around any errors that might pop up. 
        Sometimes these file types can be used interchangeably as images and animations mostly only serve to convey small bits of data.

    <h1>Unit 2, Outcome 2</h1>
    <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page   </h3>
    <p>For my website project, I laid out the paragraphs I needed to add to the project in a organised fashion. 
        I made sure to add some flare by colouring the headings and paragraphs while also using images to draw in those who would go on the website. 
        As my background was an image, I made sure to colour the font of different sentences appropriately. 
        After all, dark colours and lighter shades tended to blend together too easily sometimes. 
        It could get in the way of the overall project.

    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites   </h3>
    <p>
        Copyright laws are strict in order to maintain the rights of the original creators of a work, 
        but as long as you aren’t explicitly using someone else’s work and passing it off as your own… then it should likely be fine. 
        If not, adding references and disclaimers to the website itself should protect you from any potential harm someone could do. 
        You only have to be careful of what you use, while being aware that it’s not your own. 
        It isn’t necessary to be a hundred percent original all the time.

    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - 
        describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them   </h3>
    <p>
        When making a website, 
        the issue of making it able to be navigated by those with disabilities is by using colouring and the functions appropriately. 
        Those with no eyesight would need functions that can be worked through a text reader while those with a learning disability may need subtitles that explain navigation tools in greater detail. 
        A professional website at least has the latter done right.

    <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h3>
    <p>
        Using visual code studio and python would be the better filetype to store a website while the images and videos are best added using what would take the least memory. 
        Although JPEG can make images use us less memory, 
        some images with a greater range of colours might need a PNG filetype in order to store it with less memory. 
        JPEG isn’t a universal filetype that can work for anything, 
        so it’s also important to research what would show up with the highest quality and least memory quantity.
