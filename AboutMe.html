    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p> My name is Usman Subhani. 
        I’m someone who had grew up doing computer courses throughout school and college, 
        to the point that even more than a year’s absence from using a computer can’t make me forget what’s ingrained into me, 
        I have experience with various programs such as photoshop and currently am still good at using the knowledge I’ve acquired. 
        The reason I chose tto join this programming course is because I am confident the mix of skills, 
        I’ve cultivated over the years would help me pursue a job that is mostly computer related. 
        My fast typing skills and ability to adapt is something I will take with me to any opportunity I am able to find.
