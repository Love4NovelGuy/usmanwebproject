    <h1> Unit 1</h1>
    <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h3>
    <p>
        It is an essential component for all businesses in this era where most work is done online or in documents on a hard drive.[1] 
        Even if your business isn’t directly related to IT, there are so many functions utilised on the computer that would help better than through more retro methods. 
        IT is used for communication, editing files, advertise, as well as the recording and sorting information for work inside a business. 
        Paper notes and even doing everything on an iPhone isn’t as convenient as what IT can offer. 
        So many things that would have needed to be done separately can now be done all at once using applications. 
        On top of that, security is top-notch so long as you are careful of your passwords and protect yourself from cybercrime. 
        Information Management is key.
    </p>
</body>
<body>
    <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully– 
        what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h3>
    <p>
        An independent digital project would only need motivation and the ability to fulfil all the criteria’s needed to finish a project. 
        The concept, what applications you use, how you manage time, 
        and what are your deadlines for completing drafts will all be in your hands. 
        The skills of being self-motivated and can fix issues on your own is something difficult, 
        but doing it independently can also make others forgive a lack of expansion on the project, 
        as one person can only do so much. 
        The tools such as a computer to work on and the applications you use are your own personal responsibility. 
        Even using the internet for references must be self-recorded, 
        with one person responsible for everything.
<br>
<br>
    A team-based digital project may sound more effective, as two heads are better than one, 
    but all in all, it has its own set of problems… 
    This is especially true when it’s the first time a team is working together, 
    as uncooperative members may take credit for another’s achievements and even go as far as to obstruct the whole team for fulfilling their goals. 
    Slack or any other form of a communication application would be used to get members to keep up with each other and share progress, 
    and Kanban’s like Trello would be used to keep track on who has what responsibility. 
    It takes a dedicated team cooperative with each other to properly utilise these applications, 
    as sometimes better leadership skills aren’t as important as people who know how to take responsibility for assignments before they are given a role. 
    Tasks can be shared, but it takes being able to understand each other quickly to make sure each task isn’t being handled in an ineffective way. 
    Talking is really essential!
    </p>
</body>

<body>
    <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? </h3>
    
    <p>
        I'd use Python and mark my progress with Trello.[3][4] As this would be done In a programming application, 
        then I would need to heavily script sequences and links whether they be to pages within the website or outside on the web. 
        Multi-phrase scripting would require necessary attention to detail and the skill to correct mistakes in codes without panicking. 
        Then files would be processed into the piece of work in order to do two things: 
        The first would be making the finished product more appealing to the eye, 
        while also displaying a theme that would make it easier for newcomers to take in the information being displayed on screen. 
        Presentation is just as important as programming the website as lack of creativity could cause the reader to lack focus and skim sentences. 
        Images as animations can also be a lot more informative and expressive than words.
    </p>
</body>

<body>
    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h3>
    
    <p>
        There are risks fare beyond Team Management on a digital project.[5] 
        While uncooperative teammates are a more general risk in all projects. 
        Although projects can be creative, 
        there is a balance being it and practicality that must be maintained. 
        Most game developers have this same problem as what the ‘team’ is imagining may be too far from reach, 
        which ends in cutting corners and producing a finished product that does not live up standards. 
        Poor concepts for a project can come from too high expectations or a lack of definition or direction. 
        This, along with problems in management can also cause a project to completely flop and disappoint the entire team. 
        The team’s overall enthusiasm to complete the project is just one part of a larger whole.
    </p>
</body>

<body>
    <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – 
        how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h3>
    
    <p>
        Any project would have a preparation stage before it even starts where the individuals involved with it would communicate and discuss what application they would be using to complete the project. 
        The final application chosen would define the final product as even the difference of two programming software’s like Java and Python are distinct. 
        The significance of a what software used cannot be understated, 
        and the decision on the final choice must accepted by the majority if any digital project wants to go smoothly. 
        Picking the exact IT systems and software is less about which one is ‘better’ bit more on practicality. 
        It wouldn’t matter how good the tools are if the people working using them cannot understand how to use them. 
        It’s best to know how experienced and good you are at using the tools beforehand, 
        just in case an unforeseen problem occurs.
<br>
<br>
        The second constraint is presentation and the ability to interact with your audience through professional and personal content. 
        It has to be focused and not make anyone confused about the true purpose of the website by putting too many links. 
        Having a modern aesthetic to your website helps keep people on it engaged, and live updates shows it’s still running. 
        This way even the current generation who likes mobile friendly content can go on without worries.[2]
    </p>
</body>

<body>
    <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – 
        How has Trello helped you plan, how can git and GitHub help with your code’s version control? </h3>
    <p>
    Python is the most useful tool for programming as it is easy to learn and something that can do many things so long as you pay close attention to how you write your codes. 
    This paired with Trello allows teams to function more efficiently as Kanban boards with notes that help team members keep track of progress and contribution. 
    The most important application has to be Slack and Zoom though as communication in both words and writing helps you get past the planning phase smoothly without errors.
    Once past that phase, it will also help teammates cooperate to test ideas while discarding anything too unrealistic or too difficult to finish in a short span of time.
<br>
<br>
    GitHub is a repository hosting service that saves Gits, which are the most used version control systems. 
    It tracks progress made to files and makes it easier to collaborate with others.[6][7] 
    This is because multiple people can make changes to a file without while all being in one source. 
    If Git is a command tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphic interface… 
    such as Wikis and basic task management tools for every project. 
    It allows for more interconnected projects on the fly.

    <h1>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h1>
    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – 
        in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h3>
    <p>
        I’m happy with how things went. 
        Some of the applications like Trello seem like they’re needlessly complicating the project, but you get used to them over time. 
        Programming using Visual Studio Code and Python was actually easier than I imagined considering that coding is difficult to get the hang of at first. 
        I remember there being simpler applications to make a website, 
        but I also understand that doing it through visual studio can it more potential. 
        It was a god experience to me overall.    
    </p>
</body>

<body>
    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h3>
    <p>
        Visual Studio was the best programming method to use for creating a website for beginner’s like me as it’s a lot simpler than coding formulas used in Java and other coding applications. 
        Trello on the other hand needlessly made things more difficult since it was easier to send things through Slack. 
        A project using Trello would benefit a collective of a team, 
        but individuals wouldn’t need Trello considering they will have to do their tasks anyway. 
        A notepad is easier used to remember tasks.    
    </p>
</body>
<body>
    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? 
        Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h3>
    <p>
        I’m happy with the final draft of my websites design. As someone who would try to improve things endlessly, 
        it isn’t that I am not content with what I have but that I always believe that anything could be improved to exceed expectations. 
        Perhaps if I could change it, I would look for a more interesting theme and implement it. 
        However, I’m aware of time constraints so I’d only do such a thing if I believed there to be enough time to complete the project without going overboard.
    </p> 
</body>

<body>
    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project   </h3>
    <p>
        I’d add a more appealing list and links. 
        There are many things that could be visually and functionally improved on the website in order to make it more professional overall. 
        If I used a theme that better fit what I have written down. 
        It would also increase the website’s appeal. 
        One part that would need particular attention would be what would happen if the person opening it shrunk their browser or navigated around. 
        Things like this is what would make it easier to navigate the website.
    </p> 
</body>

<body>
    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h3>
    <p>
        I believe the outcomes fit the purpose of the task given as the website is functional and easy to use despite not breaking expectations. 
        The purpose of the website only needed functionality rather than the highest appeal of a professional work. 
        The content is appropriate and there doesn’t seem to be any flaws in the functionality. 
        There are buttons that can lead to other pages and it looks visually fine for something that was coded within the span of two days. 
        Everything is up to standard.
    </p> 
</body>

<body>
    <h1>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review)</h1>
    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – 
        could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  </h3>
    <p>
        Doing the project in teams would have either improved or decreased productivity even if everyone was familiar with the other. 
        There are so many ways things could go wrong but using the IT tools provided would have helped us keep track of progress. 
        The way I personally could have been more efficient in making my website would be if I had more familiarity with my IT Tools and used them without feeling hesitant. 
        People tend to hesitate when they don’t have experience.    
    </p>
</body>

<body>
    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  </h3>
    <p>
        The way to improve productivity would be having more time. 
        Anything can be improved as long as you use your time effectively to get advice and improve the code itself. 
        Managing time is also important as there are a lot of ways to forget what you are aiming for while working on independently. 
        Rather than using Trello, having more updated examples of codes we could use on one website would have made things easier. 
    </p> 
</body>

<body>
    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – 
        what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?  </h3>
    <p>
        I feel as if I contributed enough as a team member when we were doing a group project but nevertheless could have done more to get everyone involved. 
        Sometimes I would forget I could communicate my thoughts using Slack, 
        and I realised only some time later that there would have been more effective ways to communicate using the best parts of Zoom and Slack. 
        Sometimes it is easier to get your point across through writing than through actual words.
    </p> 
</body>

<body>
    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions  </h3>
    <p>
        Testing is essential to check the functionality of a website coding draft and so on. 
        Without it, any digital project would be hard to understand improve. 
        Sometimes you can even find alternative solutions for the problem at hand once you identify what error occurred. 
        After seeing if an error can be fixed with a simple solution, I’d implement it straightforwardly. 
        If the solution would actually require overhauling previous codes, 
        then I’d try make sure that the code is redone properly.
